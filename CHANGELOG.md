## v0.13.7

### Changed
- Change default value for usbcolorcorrection from 1->0.

## v0.13.5

### Note 
The FPGA must be updated to v18.9 or newer for PCB-aware battery voltage estimate

### Changed 
- Uses most significant bit of 16-bit ADC packet sent from FPGA to determine which
battery voltage calculation to execute.

## v0.13.4

### Note
The FPGA must be updated to v18.7 or newer for fixed sprite palette behavior

### Changed
- Fixed bug where sprite palettes are not set correctly when using palette
selection tab.

## v0.13.3

### Note
The FPGA must be updated to v18.6 or newer for palette selection and updated
frame blending behavior.

### Added
- The ability to change the color palette for non-GBC titles through a Palette tab.

### Changed
- Renamed the frame blending toggle button text to "1:1" from "3:1" to clarify
the updated FPGA approach.
- Added redundancy to two-option menu widgets. Press B to toggle previous choice.
- Added up/down roll over to bottom/top for OSD navigation.

## v0.13.2

### Added
- The ability to mock button to the FPGA.

### Changed
- Simplified the firmware version reported the system tab. Press A to see details.

## v0.13.0

### Added
- Option to ignore diagonal inputs from the D-Pad
- Option to use the background palette 0 color (prevents screen transition flashing)
- Option to set low battery icon display behavior
- Added message to brightness to indicate low power mode is active
- Added hot keys to the Controls tab

### Changed
- Tuned battery voltage thresholds for 1.2V NiMH AA's
- Prevent backlight adjustments when in low power mode
- Renamed 'USB Color Correction' menu option to 'Streaming'
- Redesigned Controls tab, toggle option text

## v0.12.3

### Note
The FPGA must be updated to v17.0 or newer as the underlying communication protocol changed.

## Added
- Sleep the MCU on power up to reduce power consumption.
- Support LiPo battery thresholds and charging indication in the battery menu.

## Fixed
- Highest brightness setting is not properly restored on power up.
- Hot key brightness adjustments are saved between power cycles

### Changed
- Supports updated UART protocol.

## Removed
- The Frame Blending text hint on the Display screen.

## v0.11.2
This is the first production release.
