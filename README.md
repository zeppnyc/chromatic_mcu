# Chromatic MCU
This repository houses the ModRetro Chromatic's MCU design files.

## Toolchain Setup
The project relies on the EspressIF IoT Development Framework (IDF) for development and debugging. Please set up the ESP32 according to the instructions at https://idf.espressif.com/.

### Windows
Please run the official ESP32 installer.

### Linux
The Ubuntu 24.04 steps are summarized below:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git wget flex bison gperf python3 python3-pip python3-venv cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util libusb-1.0-0
cd ~/path/to/clone/esp-idf
git clone -b v5.3 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf

# Installs to the default ~/.espressif path. See IDF_TOOLS_PATH for an alternative.
./install.sh esp32

# Update your path for your current session so that the `idf.py` tool can be accessed.
source ./export.sh
```

To permanently update your environment path, add the following to your shell startup script (e.g. `~/.bashrc`):
```
alias get_idf='. $HOME/esp-idf/export.sh'
```

where `$HOME/esp-idf` is where you cloned the ESP IDF toolchain. Anytime you wish to develop, run `get_idf` in your terminal first. EspressIF does not recommend always running `export.sh` for every terminal. This may have unintended side effects.

## Build, Flashing, and Debugging

Run `idf.py -p PORT build flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project. The default baud rate is `115200`.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

Each of these steps can be issued individually (build, flash, and monitor).

## Serial Interface
The Chromatic FPGA supports a composite USB device consisting of several device classes. One of them is a serial interface used for flashing and debugging. The setup steps depend on your operating system.

### Windows
A serial port for the ESP32 should already appear in the Device Manager as a COM device.
You can also see this by issuing `modes` within a command prompt.

### Linux
Ensure you are part of the `dialout` group. You will need to log out and log back in after issuing the following command:
```bash
sudo gpasswd --add $USER dialout
```

If everything is working, you should see `/dev/ttyACM0` appear as the communications port to the MCU.  

If this `idf.py` command above fails, you may need to check your system's `udev` rules.
